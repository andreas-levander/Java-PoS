## Setup  

### Requirements  

- Java 8/10 for the [external jars](/Jars/).  
- Client and Backend was made with Java 18 so you should use that to be sure it works correctly.  
- PostgreSQL database (tested with v14.5).

### Quick Start  

1. Setup a PostgreSQL database wherever you like, you can use the [provided docker compose](/backend/database/compose.yaml) if you have docker and you can use `docker compose up` to start it.    
2. Modify the database info in the [application.yaml](/backend/src/main/resources/application.yaml) with your database info. (this step can be ignored if you use the provided docker compose)
3. Start all the [external jars](/Jars/), you can use the [provided batch file](/Jars/startall.bat) by first editing it and setting the location to java8/10 then you can run it and it should start all of them.
